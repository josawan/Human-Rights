<h1>The Magna Carta </h1>
    <p><strong>
      Although the Magna Carta (The Great Charter), issued in England in 1215, was essentially an agreement aimed at resolving a conflict between King John and the feudal barons, it transcended its narrow context to become a cornerstone in the construction of the idea of human rights. It was not about "human rights" in the contemporary sense, but it planted the seeds of principles that became fundamental to it. It did not achieve equality for all, but it established the principle that power must be constrained by law, Clause 39 states: "No free man shall be seized or imprisoned, or stripped of his rights or possessions except by the lawful judgement of his peers or by the law of the land Connection to Human Rights: This is the foundation upon which all modern charters are built. It limits the arbitrariness of power and ensures that everyone – from the ruler to the ruled – is subject to the law. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (Article 7) states that "All are equal before the law, The aforementioned Clause 39 contained the seed of the concept of due process of law ,the right to be tried by one's lawful judge and not by a special tribunal, and not to be imprisoned or punished without a trial.Connection to Human Rights: This right is the cornerstone of modern criminal justice. It is elaborated in Article 10 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights Everyone is entitled in full equality to a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal, The document itself was a commitment by the king that his power was not absolute. It was a contract between the ruler and the ruled, although the ruled at that time were only the class of nobles, The idea that the state must commit to respecting the rights and freedoms of its citizens and must not abuse its power is the central idea in international human rights law, Rights are boundaries that the state must not cross.
It is important to note that the Magna Carta was not a universal declaration of human rights in the modern sense, for the following reasons, Narrow Scope: The term free man in its texts excluded the vast majority of the population, such as peasants (serfs) and women ,Class Motives: It was created to solve a political crisis between the ruling elite and the king, not out of a belief in human equality, Despite its historical limitations, the Magna Carta remains a pivotal moment in human history. It transformed the concept of rights from a grant given by the ruler into a legal claim that could be defended against his arbitrariness The seeds it planted  the rule of law, the right to a fair trial, and the limits of power  grew and branched out over the centuries to eventually bear fruit in universal documents like the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948). Therefore, we can say that the Magna Carta was the historical and ethical nucleus from which the concept of human rights, as we know it today, emerged.
