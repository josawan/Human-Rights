<h1>Crises and Conflicts</h1>
<p><strong>Human rights are among the most important values and principles that modern societies strive to establish in their laws, constitutions, and international agreements. They represent the foundation of justice, equality, and human dignity. However, when countries experience major crises or become involved in armed conflicts, these rights are exposed to serious threats and are often violated due to chaos, the weakening of law, and the prioritization of political or military interests over humanitarian values.
During times of war, civilians are usually the main victims of severe violations such as extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearances, torture, and deliberate attacks on civilian facilities like hospitals and schools. Millions are forced to flee their homes, seeking safety elsewhere or becoming refugees in foreign countries creating massive humanitarian crises. Women and girls often suffer the most, facing sexual violence and exploitation, while children are sometimes recruited to fight or are deprived of education and healthcare.
Human rights violations are not limited to armed conflicts; they also occur during economic, political, or health crises  such as the COVID-19 pandemic, which revealed the fragility of social protection systems in many countries. In such situations, freedom of expression may be restricted, and discrimination in access to resources or healthcare services may increase, deepening the suffering of vulnerable groups.
International organizations play a vital role in confronting these violations. The United Nations, through bodies such as the Human Rights Council, the UNHCR, and the World Food Programme, works to provide humanitarian aid and monitor human rights conditions in conflict zones. The International Criminal Court also seeks to hold perpetrators of war crimes and crimes against humanity accountable. However, these efforts face many challenges including lack of funding, refusal of states to cooperate, and the use of veto power by major powers to shield their allies from accountability.
It is essential to recognize that protecting human rights during crises
