 <h1>The UN Charter </h1>
    <p><strong>The UN Charter, signed in 1945, is the main document that established the United Nations after World War II. Its purpose was to maintain international peace and security, but it also placed great focus on human rights and the dignity of every person. The Charter recognized that peace cannot exist without equality, freedom, and justice, In the Preamble, it mentions faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person, and in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small, This shows that promoting human rights was a key goal of the UN from the start, Several articles clearly highlight this idea
<li>Article 1 (3): Promotes respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all people, without discrimination.

<li>Articles 55 and 56: Call on member states to cooperate to improve living standards and ensure universal respect for human rights.

<li>Articles 62 and 68: Give the Economic and Social Council the authority to recommend actions and create commissions to promote human rights worldwide.


These principles became the foundation of international human rights law and inspired the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) in 1948, along with the creation of organizations like the UN Human Rights Council, the UN Charter made human rights a central part of achieving global peace, equality, and respect for every human being.
